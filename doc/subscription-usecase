Use cases for subscriptions

  use case 1:
  Plans are started differently
  be able to start the date it's paid, ex 17/10/15 -> 17/11/15
  have static start dates, is paid middle of month but still counts from the begining of the month

  use case 2:
  Plans in subscription are billed seperatly or togheter
  2 plans in subscription are billed seperatly and can then have different intervals and startdate
  plan added will run on it's on startdate

  use case 3:
  2 plans are billed togheter and must then have same interval and start date
  plan added with same interval will be synced to the existing startdate

  

Studentlund use case:

  on registration 3 plans are added:
  All of them should have same interval and startdate
  they should all be billed togheter

  if registration takes place in the middle of the semester it should still
  expire in the end of the semester

  a plan should be swappable and not effect the status of the Subscription
  (this is the undefined to defined nation case)

  a plan should be swappable and affect the status of the Subscription the user should
  then only have to pay for the swapped plan. the startdate should sync up with the other
  plans
  (this is if the member has paid for organisation 1 and want to swap to organisation 2)
